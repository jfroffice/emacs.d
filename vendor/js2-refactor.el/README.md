# js2-refactor.el [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/magnars/js2-refactor.el.png)](http://travis-ci.org/magnars/js2-refactor.el)

The beginnings of a JavaScript refactoring library in emacs.

This is a collection of small refactoring functions to further the idea of a
JavaScript IDE in Emacs that started with js2-mode.

## Installation

Start by installing the dependencies:

 * js2-mode https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode/
 * mark-multiple https://github.com/magnars/mark-multiple.el

It is also recommended to get
[expand-region](https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el) to more easily mark
vars, method calls and functions for refactorings.

Then add this to your emacs settings:

    (require 'js2-refactor)

## Usage

All refactorings start with `C-c C-m` and then a two-letter mnemonic shortcut.

 * `ef` is `extract-function`: Extracts the marked expressions out into a new named function.
 * `em` is `extract-method`: Extracts the marked expressions out into a new named method in an object literal.
 * `eo` is `expand-object`: Converts a one line object literal to multiline.
 * `co` is `contract-object`: Converts a multiline object literal to one line.
 * `wi` is `wrap-buffer-in-iife`: Wraps the entire buffer in an immediately invoked function expression
 * `ig` is `inject-global-in-iife`: Creates a shortcut for a marked global by injecting it in the wrapping immediately invoked function expression
 * `ag` is `add-to-globals-annotation`: Creates a `/*global */` annotation if it is missing, and adds the var at point to it.
 * `ev` is `extract-var`: Takes a marked expression and replaces it with a var.
 * `iv` is `inline-var`: Replaces all instances of a variable with its initial value.
 * `rv` is `rename-var`: Renames the variable on point and all occurrences in its lexical scope.
 * `vt` is `var-to-this`: Changes local `var a` to be `this.a` instead.
 * `ao` is `arguments-to-object`: Replaces arguments to a function call with an object literal of named arguments. Requires yasnippets.
 * `3i` is `ternary-to-if`: Converts ternary operator to if-statement.
 * `sv` is `split-var-declaration`: Splits a `var` with multiple vars declared, into several `var` statements.
 * `uw` is `unwrap`: Replaces the parent statement with the selected region.

There are also some minor conveniences bundled:

 * `C-S-down` and `C-S-up` moves the current line up or down. If the line is an
   element in an object or array literal, it makes sure that the commas are
   still correctly placed.

## Bugs

 * **Undoing past an extract-variable messes up the buffer.** It's definitely
   because of mark-multiple being used in an interactive command that also
   modifies the buffer. The contents of master is mirrored. One possible solution
   is to modify mark-multiple to be more like multiple-cursors. Other solutions
   are most welcome.

## Todo

A list of some wanted improvements for the current refactorings.

 * expand- and contract-object: should work for arrays.
 * expand- and contract-object: should work for simple functions.
 * wrap-buffer-in-iife: should skip comments and namespace initializations at buffer start.
 * extract-variable: could end with a query-replace of the expression in its scope.

Thanks!

## Contribute

This project is still in its infancy, and everything isn't quite sorted out
yet. If you're eager to contribute, please add an issue here on github and we
can discuss your changes a little before diving into the elisp. :-)

To fetch the test dependencies:

    $ cd /path/to/multiple-cursors
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

Run the tests with:

    $ ./util/ecukes/ecukes features
